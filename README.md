# LM393-Mic-Pcb
LM393 based microphone module for arduinos. This wil become a part of another bigger project and serves as a copyable module for it. PCB prototype is for testing the circuit and seeing if it catches fire or not.

## Panelization
The panelized variant is an experiment to see, if the manufacturer this gets ordered from is able to see v-scores and on which layers it gets recognized. The experimental panel uses (46 Milling) and (102 Vscore) to test this. No further remarks will be left to the manufacturer.
